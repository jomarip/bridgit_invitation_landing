				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">If you work with documents (and chances are you do), you know just how important the data and information stored in your documents really is.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s face it: businesses depend on the flow of documents to exchange ideas, keep others informed, and report data across departments and organizations. Great care goes into the creation of a given document and its delivery. At the core, though, a document is really only as valuable as the information it contains. The document itself, and the tools you use to create it, are essentially just entries in the cost column of your profits &amp; losses statement each month. In an era of “lean” businesses, why not cut down the costs involved in the creation and delivery of documents?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Think of all that costly paper, printer jams, ink cartridges, toner cartridges, and tech support, and  it is really safe to say that there must be a better way.<br />
<span id="more-400"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Full disclosure: Before I get too far into this article, I need to tell you the whole truth. I hate printers. I have a lousy history with them &#8212; and scanners, copiers and fax machines, for that matter &#8212; and I have long wished for a better way to exchange and store documents. Over the years, I have had many utterly wonky, non-working printers, leading me to rather embarrassing fits of fist pounding and at least three dramatic printer “sacrifices.” As a matter of fact, right now as I type this, I have a 2013-model printer glaring at me nearby, that simply will not work. I’m using current drivers, a good cable, and a late-model computer; but, nope, it&#8217;s just a space-gobbling paperweight. (Come on, I can&#8217;t be the only one who has had fantasies of reenacting this foul-mouthed scene from &#8220;Office Space,&#8221; right?)</p>
<p><object width="560" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="//www.youtube.com/v/PywI0BOxJpI?hl=en_GB&amp;version=3" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="560" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="//www.youtube.com/v/PywI0BOxJpI?hl=en_GB&amp;version=3" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p dir="ltr">Personally, I&#8217;ve prayed for a better option. Then, came PandaDoc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If – like me &#8211; you&#8217;ve ever hoped for a little more from your documents (and a lot less stress,) you’ll welcome PandaDoc to your office or at home. PandaDoc lets you create, send, track, and sign documents using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank">computing cloud</a> together with a fully interactive user interface. Since it is based entirely in the cloud, PandaDoc also helps you dodge all the pitfalls mentioned above, meaning no more costly cartridges or stifling printer jams. Frankly, with PandaDoc, all the headache of drafting documents should become a thing of the past.</p>
<p dir="ltr">PandaDoc offers a flexible, analytical, collaborative, and simple feature set that lets you get the most out of your documents.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Here are five ways PandaDoc streamlines the way you do documents:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">In-document analytics</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Using paper, you sometimes get feedback, but it’s rarely the kind you want. In school, you sometimes get your documents back from the instructor with red ink all over them. This is generally unpleasant, and something that we’d all like to see left out of the world of business. Anytime you create a spreadsheet, a memo, or any other type of document, you inevitably wonder “Did they even read it?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">With PandaDoc’s in-document analytics, you gain an insight into what your recipient views within a document. When the recipient opens the document, you receive an email from PandaDoc. Using PandaDoc’s web-based analysis and reporting tools, you can log in and see what the recipient has seen in your document, what parts they looked at and how much time they spent looking at each part. This lets you – for the first time – know exactly how effective your documents are.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Total flexibility</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">PandaDoc can handle all of the most in-demand file types, from word processor files to spreadsheets, to presentations and more. Whether you (and your recipients) work on Windows or Mac, Android or iOS, PandaDoc has you covered, providing cross-platform operation and sharing, via the cloud.</p>
<p dir="ltr">PandaDoc works with third-party apps and services, giving you full control of how you use it. What’s more, PandaDoc is responsive and automatically resizes your documents to fit your laptop display, LCD screen, smartphone, or tablet. PandaDoc presents your documents wherever you – or the recipient – happen to need them.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Collaboration</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The other great advantage to the interactive tools inside PandaDoc is that your documents become more collaborative than ever. Not only can electronic signatures be captured inside your documents, using PandaDoc, but you can also receive feedback. Recipients can leave comments directly inside your documents. You can even integrate photos, videos, and links. No more bland and boring documents; with PandaDoc, your documents – moreover, your data and info – come alive.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Ease of Use</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">PandaDoc is extremely easy to use, as well. You’ll be up and running in no time, sending your first document with PandaDoc. You can also quickly convert your old docs into PandaDocs, so there&#8217;s no rewriting, reformatting or excessive copy-pasting to turn that boring, old doc into an interactive web experience in no time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you&#8217;ve ever used a service like Dropbox or Right Signature, you will have no trouble using PandaDoc.  Likewise, if you have experience with creating documents using desktop applications like Office and iWork, you will find there to be no learning curve involved in getting started with PandaDoc. It’s really just that simple and intuitive.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-408 aligncenter" alt="The Paperless Office" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Paperless-Office.jpg" width="601" height="601" /></p>
<ol start="5">
<li dir="ltr">
<h3 dir="ltr">Paperless productivity</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.mrtaxman.com.au/blog/office-workers-waste-two-weeks-a-year-on-paper-jams">One recent study</a> shows that paper jams alone account for plenty of wasted time in the workplace &#8212; the average office drone spends two work weeks a year unjamming paper! Putting your documents into the cloud with PandaDoc is a great way to recoup all that lost productivity. Since PandaDoc sends your documents instantly, there is no wait time. Nor are you waiting for big files to upload or frustrated your doc is too big for your email; with PandaDoc, your recipients just receive a simple, secure link to your doc, or, when you or the recipient likes, you can attach a PDF (or Dropbox it, etc, for that matter.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most importantly to me, there is no time lost on paper jams or other technical difficulties. If this is a contract or an important document you really want signed, you don&#8217;t want them worried about stressing over downloading, uploading, unjamming, printing, scanning, and such when you want them just saying Yes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As we have <a href="http://pandadoc.com/blog/2013/06/paperless-kill-your-costs/">previously reported</a>, going paperless not only helps you cut costs, it also benefits the environment. Since going paperless means you will save trees, you also save on fuel costs involved in shipping reams of paper, while reducing the amount of resources expended on mailing parcels around the globe. The pandas will thank you! (Though you might not understand them because pandas are quite lazy and slow to write thank you notes. Plus, most of them only speak Mandarin, anyway.)</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Ready to do documents right?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The above five reasons to try PandaDoc are also reasons to abandon paper documents for good. Business methodologies that are woefully inefficient must, eventually, go the way of <a href="http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Dodo">the Dodo</a>. Sometimes, the reason inefficient technologies linger for longer than they should is because there is nothing to replace them. Thanks to the advantages offered by PandaDoc, this is no longer the case when it comes to documents. Kick your printer and paper and ink budget &#8211; along with those frustrations &#8211; to the curb.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you’re anything like me, you’ve probably been looking for a reason to do just that; now you have your justification, thanks to PandaDoc.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Are you wasting time, money, and effort on paper documents?</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A business plan is essential to your company&#8217;s success. After all, <a href="http://corporatetaxnetwork.com/bizplans.php" target="_blank">seven out of ten businesses fail</a> within five years. We know, you&#8217;re starting a new business or moving to expand and you got to stay focused on the positive &#8212; the last thing you want to talk about is failure. But, for 70 percent of businesses, failure is the reality, and a major cause of said sad failure is a lack of planning. Whether it&#8217;s insufficient market research, financial planning, management, lack of social media or webpage, or something else, these mistakes all boil down to a lack of planning that can be traced back to the roots of your company: the business plan.</p>
<p>A business plan is, of course, integral in selling your company to potential investors and bankers. But, just as important, the process of writing a business plan involves you and your partners taking a real look at what you want the future of your company to look like and how you&#8217;re going to make it happen. Although business plans are like snowflakes, this write a better business plan guide is to give you some things to consider, no matter the size of the company. Follow our steps and use <a href="http://www.quoteroller.com/proposal-templates/business-plan-template/" target="_blank">our free business plan template</a> as a sort of checklist when talking about and creating your own plan. <span id="more-336"></span></p>
<h2>Before putting pen to paper (or fingers to keys)</h2>
<p>Before you begin, it&#8217;s necessary to brainstorm, making sure your team is prepared to answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are we starting/ ready to expand this business?</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">What makes our company different? How can we differentiate ourselves?</span></li>
<li>What solution are we providing? How do we provide it?</li>
<li>Who are we? Be ready to introduce your management team, any key players and advisors.</li>
<li>Who are your customers? Target business?</li>
<li>How are we going to fund our business? How much money do you need to start?</li>
<li>What needs to happen to break even?</li>
<li>How are you able to make a profit? In one year? In five years?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are dozens of other questions, sector-specific or otherwise, you should be asking, but <strong>these eight are the questions that your business plan must address in a clear, concise, strategic and realistic way.</strong> (Yes, being an entrepreneur is about dreaming, but nobody but you and your mom care about your dreams &#8212; investors want to know what you can do for them and they want you to offer some sort of guarantee.) <img alt="Business Plan Cards" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Business-Plan-Cards12.jpg" width="950" height="346" /></p>
<h2>Piece by piece</h2>
<p>A business plan can get to be rather long &#8212; just make sure it&#8217;s not too long! You want to make sure you include every important bit, so organization is crucial. With that in mind, we are going to break down the pieces of a business plan. There is no hard-fast rule for private business plans, however remember to follow whatever example a bank or loan agency gives you down to the letter. For a regular plan, however, as long as you address all the key points, there can be room for some creativity; we are just sharing with you the most common headlines and sections found in well-received plans.</p>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This is where you (succinctly) introduce your vision. Try to make sure your exec sum answers these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em style="font-size: 13px;">What sector are you in? </em></li>
<li><em style="font-size: 13px;">What products/services do you provide? </em></li>
<li><em style="font-size: 13px;">Who is your target audience? </em></li>
<li><em style="font-size: 13px;">What does the future of your industry look like? </em></li>
<li><em style="font-size: 13px;">How is your company scaleable? </em></li>
<li><em style="font-size: 13px;">What are the next steps? </em></li>
<li><em style="font-size: 13px;">Who are the owners of your company? </em><em style="font-size: 13px;">Backgrounds? Experience in sector/business?</em></li>
<li><em style="font-size: 13px;">What motivated you to start your company? Why now?</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>Yes, this part is important to you and your team. However, this isn&#8217;t <em>quite as</em> important to your audience as you think it is. Follow the KISS rule: Keep It Simple, Stupid. Your mission statement should include your <strong>goal </strong>and the <strong>objectives</strong> that will lead you toward it; your <strong>industry</strong>, how you see it evolving in the short and long term, and who your <strong>customers</strong> are. Your mission statement also says <strong>who you are</strong>, and talks about the strengths of you and your team. This is where you, in part (and in brief,) sell the features and benefits of your company.  <i> </i></p>
<h2>Products and/or Services</h2>
<p>This is, of course, what you do and what you plan to sell it for. This is also where you sell the <b>benefits</b> of the features of what you have to offer. Previously, we told you about <a href="http://pandadoc.com/blog/2013/06/how-to-build-a-business-plan/" target="_blank">how to create an online business plan</a>. One of the many wows of an online plan is that you don&#8217;t have to just describe what you&#8217;re selling on boring black-and-white printer paper &#8212; you can show it! You can use videos, photos, links and other interactive tools to engage the reader or perspective investor and to show them the viability (and attractiveness) of your products/service, not just tell them.</p>
<p>This being a business plan and all, it&#8217;s important to list the cost of the products/services you are providing:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How much does it cost to produce?</em> versus <em>How much will you sell each piece for?</em></li>
<li><em>Is there packaging?</em></li>
<li><em>How will the client purchase the product? </em></li>
<li><em>What system will you use to bill them? </em></li>
<li><em>Are there </em><em>extra costs in getting it to the customer? How will it be transported?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The products/services section should also differentiate your new business:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>What makes your business different?</i></li>
<li><em>What gives your product or service an edge in the marketplace?</em></li>
<li><em>What distinguishes it from competitors? </em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are selling a product, sell the general idea of it and its benefits in this section, but don&#8217;t get too technical. Leave any sort of diagrams or complex designs for the addendum, while inserting the phrase: &#8220;For more detail, visit the addendum Page #.&#8221;</p>
<h3><img class=" wp-image-388 aligncenter" alt="Business Plan Cards" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Business-Plan-Cards2.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></h3>
<h2>Marketing Plan</h2>
<p>OK, by now you should have proven <em>what</em> you want to do and <em>how </em>will make it happen. Now they want to know how you&#8217;re going to get the word out. This is where you prove you know what you&#8217;re talking about and that you and your team are ready to provide a service to a proven audience. Your marketing plan should be the result of a blend of first- and (reputable) second-hand research into your marketplace. Break down your marketing plan into sections, grouping by market topic. We suggest these seven:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Your Customers</strong>: Are you B2B or B2C? Who are your customers? How do you plan on reaching them? Where will you sell your product/service? How will you garner feedback from them? How will they know you care?</span></li>
<li><strong>Your Competition</strong>: Who are your direct/indirect competitors? What&#8217;s your advantage? Don&#8217;t be shy here &#8212; <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">tell them you are better and why</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Your Niche</strong>: Or market or sector. For our sister site Quote Roller, clearly our niche is sales professionals in SMBs. For PandaDoc, we don&#8217;t really have a niche &#8212; it&#8217;s really anyone who interacts with documents. Again, what separates you from your competitors &#8212; how will you make yourself room in the niche?</li>
<li><strong>Your Distribution</strong>: Of course, this is a marketing plan, so they&#8217;ll want to know your tricks for promoting** within said niche. How are you selling it &#8212; directly to clients, to a vendor, online, at a store, an office, freelance, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Your Advertising</strong>: Are you advertising already? Where? When you have more funding, where do you plan to advertise? How will you use advertising to retain customers? Get new ones? Make sure you outline your marketing budget either here or within the financial plan. How much will be spent on print, TV/radio, Internet, direct mail, external ads, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Your Sales Strategy</strong>: Depending on the sector, <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">this could be one of the most important parts of your entire business plan</span> &#8212; how are you going to sell your product/service? Online? A sales team? Telesales? How will you incentivize sales? Will you offer a free sample? Host a free workshop?</li>
<li><strong>Your Face</strong>: You&#8217;ve described how you will market what to whom on where. Now it&#8217;s time to describe the image you&#8217;re going to project. This can include your slogan, images, logos, website, social media, etc. Again, building an online business plan can make this part much more memorable.</li>
</ol>
<p>**Without a doubt, nowadays, your marketing plan had better <a href="http://wp.me/p2KvUR-Om" target="_blank">include social networks</a>. These are free ways to advertise, so why <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> you use them? And now some stats to explain the added value of Facebook and its many friends:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Companies that use Twitter have twice as many leads as those that don&#8217;t.</span></li>
<li>Fifty-five percent of all people check out social media before making a purchase.</li>
<li>Companies with an active blog have 67-percent more leads.</li>
</ul>
<p>A marketing plan that neglects the obvious, inexpensive benefits of social media has a very visible hole.</p>
<h2>Operational Plan</h2>
<p>This part takes the reader through the day-to-day of your company, explaining the:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Location/Logistics of your business</span></li>
<li>Transportation (if you&#8217;re selling a product)</li>
<li>Legal &#8212; Do you need a permit? Licence? To join a union or other professional organization?</li>
<li>Inventory &#8212; if you&#8217;re selling a product, where will you need to store it?</li>
<li>Providers/Suppliers/Freelancers &#8212; Detailed contact info/pricing of anyone you&#8217;re outsourcing to</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a lot of tangible, concrete info, but don&#8217;t be afraid to add a lyrical (but short) introduction, painting a more visual picture of how your company will work, walking them (briefly) through your day-to-day operations. You can even include a photo or video showing them it.</p>
<p>Writing a business plan isn&#8217;t just about including all the important information, but it&#8217;s also about capturing the attention of the reader and convincing him or her that you are a solid team. Show them why you make a good team, and then feel free to add some candid shots of your team happily working together.</p>
<h2>Management Organization</h2>
<h3><img class="alignright" alt="The Honey Agency" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/The-Honey-Agency.jpg" width="288" height="300" /></h3>
<p>This includes a hierarchical chart of your company and how the operations we talked about above flow through it. List the positons and briefly describe the functions of each key member of your business, including but not limited to: board of directors, advisors, technical specialists, accomplished sales people, accountants, and lawyers. Don&#8217;t be afraid to include smiling head shots of everyone (preferably taken in front of your logo), as a way to introduce the idea of a more complete team and vision.  Again, don&#8217;t be afraid to get creative with this &#8212; it&#8217;ll show that you took extra time to represent your company as a solid team. We love how our clients <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151458551170968&amp;set=pb.75216235967.-2207520000.1372749166.&amp;type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank">The Honey Agency</a> represents their team as pieces of a busy honeycomb, instead of the more traditional chart. Especially since they&#8217;re a creative agency, they introduce their team in a fun, memorable way.</p>
<p>Then describe any plans for your staff to expand. Also, reflecting it in your financial plan, discuss any new hires you want to make and why. Your business plan isn&#8217;t just about where your company is, but where it&#8217;s headed.</p>
<h2>Fiscal Planning</h2>
<p>The fiscal piece of your business plan puzzle is the piece investors and loan managers are going to spend the most time looking at. Without proper capitalization and financial planning, even the greatest business idea that fulfills an important need is at a high risk for failing. Our sister site Quote Roller has published a <a href="http://www.quoteroller.com/proposal-templates/business-plan-template/" target="_blank">free and open business plan template</a>, which includes an awesome step-by-step, annotated guide and spreadsheet templates for each of the following charts. What must this most-looked-at part of your business plan include?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.quoteroller.com/proposal-templates/business-plan-template/7401956/" target="_blank">Cash-flow analysis</a>: This reflects what you plan to sell versus your business expenses. This projects your profit margin.<br />
<a href="http://www.quoteroller.com/proposal-templates/business-plan-template/7401957/" target="_blank">Profits &amp; Losses analysis</a>: Done in conjunction with the cash-flow, this looks ahead at least a year and includes revenue predictions, including <a href="http://www.quoteroller.com/proposal-templates/business-plan-template/7401958/" target="_blank">graphical representations</a> of those numbers.<br />

<p>Seriously, this is the part they are going to spend the most time looking at, make sure it&#8217;s thorough and realistic.</p>
<h2>Addendum</h2>
<p>As you can probably guess, this is where you talk about the rest, the boring, the things that you probably won&#8217;t need, but it shows you did your research to include. In addition, this is where you include any technical diagrams. This is also a great place to put references and press about your company, as well as resumes/CVs, adding proof of your awesomeness.</p>
<p>The business plan project manager&#8217;s job is to organize things in the most persuasive manner. Anything that&#8217;s not essential and is interrupting the flow of information should be considered being pushed to the addendum.</p>
<h2>Now, it&#8217;s time to perfect it</h2>
<h3><img class="alignright" alt="Business Plan Inspiration" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/business-plan-inspiration.jpg" width="279" height="300" /></h3>
<p>Read every word of it aloud&#8230; twice&#8230; to other people. This is how you uncover errors or bits that hinder the flow of your business plan. And remember, length matters. The addendum is there to offer extra info that could be useful, but the business plan should be able to stand alone without it.</p>
<p>Remember, size does matter &#8212; if it&#8217;s your plan and you&#8217;re bored reading it aloud, imagine being an interested third party?! Time to cut! Be ruthless!</p>
<p>Before presenting your plan to the people important to your business, present it to the people important to you first. Present it to you team, your family and friends. You know who of your this group will give you candid, constructive criticism &#8212; that&#8217;s who you want to talk to (and then maybe your sweet grandma who will just make you feel good.) Ask for candid comments, no matter how big or small.</p>
<p>Finally, <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">ask yourselves, with investors staring at a stack or two of business plans, will yours stand out?</span> Don&#8217;t be afraid to jazz it up, making it memorable with multimedia and full-color examples of your work, and don&#8217;t be afraid to appear too confident &#8212; as long as you have the goods and numbers to back it up, you&#8217;re golden.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you had that moment when you needed to print an important business document, just to find out that your printer is out of ink? Didn&#8217;t you just replace the cartridge last month? Moving a business towards being paperless is more affordable and easier than ever before. It’s time for your company to finally make the switch and we&#8217;re hear to give you the why and the how to do it.</p>
<p><em id="__mceDel"> <span id="more-237"></span></em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Stop shredding dollar bills</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Restocking printer supplies is a never-ending costly battle. Most notably, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2013/feb/23/printer-ink-cartridges-paying-more-getting-less">sky-high price of printer ink</a> is one of the most <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/consumers/liquid-expensive.html">expensive liquids</a> known to man &#8212; <strong>printer ink is more expensive than champagne and human blood!</strong> (Wait, you can buy that?) With printer cartridges containing <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2013/feb/23/printer-ink-cartridges-paying-more-getting-less">less and less ink for the same price</a>, it’s sometimes cheaper to just buy a whole new printer. According to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/05/24/153634897/why-printer-ink-is-the-other-black-gold">National Public Radio</a>, “Printer ink is so expensive in order for printers to be so cheap.” Similar to the razor and blade industry, the markups on built-in obsolescent ink cartridges are where printer companies make the most money. Once a business buys a printer, you’re stuck buying or refilling the same set of cartridges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you’ve ever seen the recently ended, hilarious mockumentary <em><a href="http://youtu.be/Amyc7EJpMf4">The Office</a></em> you know that paper is a big industry. It’s so big that in 2010, the United States alone produced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_and_paper_industry">75,849 tons of paper</a>. A study done by <a href="http://environmentalpaper.org/documents/state-of-the-paper-industry-2011-full.pdf">RISI marketing services</a> shows that North Americans consume almost 30 times more paper per capita than the average person in Africa and 6 times more than the average person in Asia. That means that the United States and Canada (about five percent of the global population) consumed 17 percent of the world’s paper! That&#8217;s a lot of trees. Which translates into a lot of dollars. Dunder Mifflin&#8217;s slogan is &#8220;A paper company for a paperless world&#8221; &#8212; need we say more?</p>
<p><object width="420" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/32MGuXgqvLw?hl=en_GB&amp;version=3" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="420" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/32MGuXgqvLw?hl=en_GB&amp;version=3" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p dir="ltr">Moving to a paperless office is a clear way to cut costs and helps your business be more efficient. While it may seem like a daunting task, going paperless is surprisingly both affordable and easily done. With services like <a href="https://www.box.com/">Box</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/drive/about.html">Google Drive</a>, a business can store all their documents safely in the cloud. No matter which service you choose, being able to backup and share files online is a smart move. Businesses can both save money and help reduce the strain on the environment by going paperless.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, us being humans that hate change and all, you will naturally see a pushback from your colleagues about the switch &#8212; it does take change to evolve. <a href="http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/06/switch-to-paperless-office.html" target="_blank"><em>Inc.</em> start-up experts recommend</a> setting deadlines, creating a well-thought-out timeline for each aspect of your business to cut out the paper. This also means that your company won&#8217;t be halted by every department adapting to new software and procedures at the same time.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Win the war against wasted time</h2>
<p dir="ltr">If you&#8217;ve ever spent hours hunting through stacks of paper for an important doc or dug through filing cabinets, you understand the frustrations of printed documents. The time saved by going paperless allows you to close deals faster and make your clients happier. We’ve talked before about the <a href="http://pandadoc.com/blog/2013/06/the-case-for-the-e-signature/">benefits of e-signatures</a>. By not having to scan in countless pages and send faxes, a business can focus more on what they do best. And your clients can decide right in the moment to approve and comment on your contracts, not having to bungle through the process of downloading, printing, signing, scanning, uploading and sending it back to you. It makes you and your company look like they’ve really got their stuff together. Speech recognition also lessons the need to jot things down, and it and fingerprinting and retinal scans are joining electric signatures to make the old way seem, well, old.<br />
<img class="alignright" alt="Be paperless" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/be-paperless.jpg" width="175" height="300" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Use going paperless as an opportunity to provide additional value to your customers. Treat the time saved as a competitive advantage that allows your business to get more done. By exchanging information electronically with vendors and customers, a business can make information quickly accessible. This is both convenient for your clients and an asset to everyone in your company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Plus, going on a cloud, you can use tracking and notification features to let you peek right inside the recipients head, knowing what they’re looking at, when, and if they’ve signed off on it.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Safe and Secure</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Switching to an electronic document management system increases security and creates consistency around the office. Going paperless provides a much higher level of security beyond printer paper. Using password protection at different levels limits the access to important information and allows for your employees to safely collaborate on documents. By creating private or <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/encryption.htm">encrypted</a> files for clients and staff, getting that document<br />
signed can be both secure and up-to-date.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many online paperless options allow for in-the-cloud access across numerous devices and platforms. For a business, this means enhanced collaboration and being able to respond more quickly to customer inquiries. Given the time zone and location differences that many growing companies face, anytime access to customer records is especially important. In a pure paper-based work environment, employees would have to physically be in an office to perform their duties.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Allows for company growth</h2>
<p dir="ltr">No matter the size of your business, going paperless can aid in speeding up your workflow and can help your venture scale. Without the need to access physical documents, individuals can work out of coworking spaces without the worry of renting out an entire office. A small business can more effectively work with partners, suppliers, contractors and employees without needed to expand storage space to accommodate additional files.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a company grows bigger, improved efficiencies and customer service become a top priority. The last thing a manager wants to worry about is making sure that the copy machine is working. (And have you ever thought about how much space copiers, scanners and printers take up?) Documents hosted in the cloud can seamlessly accessed and shared among teams, no matter how large. With tablets and laptops becoming more a norm in workplaces, having a cloud-based file sharing system in place are becoming employee and customers preference.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At larger businesses, both security and redundancy are important. Having a company-wide policy for document collaboration and an integrated system for sharing documents across an organization is a must. Large companies can go paperless from department to department by using Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions that are secure, scalable, and affordable. No matter what field of business you operate in, a paperless office is the obvious solution for a modern company.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="Save the trees" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/save-the-trees.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Save the trees! (And pandas and the ozone layer!)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The average officemate uses 10,000 pieces of paper a year. Really, with e-books and e-mail, treebooks and snailmail these numbers have become ridiculous. There&#8217;s barely a need for paper nowadays and we have to do our part for the environment, too. It&#8217;s becoming increasingly common that huge multinationals like Telefonica have become completely green offices &#8212; like going paperless and using effective energy techniques like efficient lightbulbs and condensed work schedules. They tell the press it&#8217;s for the earth, but really it&#8217;s just a common cost-saving technique, too. However, your clients will respect your attention to detail and conscientiousness.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Getting started</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Ready to go paperless? I suggest starting with this great post from <a href="http://money.howstuffworks.com/how-paperless-offices-work.htm">HowStuffWorks</a>. There are many guides online depending on the size of your business. Do you already have paperless workplace? What are your tips or tricks on making the switch? Tell us what you do!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Good news for all you small businesses out there trying to keep up with this increasingly competitive market. If I told you there was a way to substantially cut the cost of doing business while sacrificing virtually nothing would you believe me? Maybe not, (how can you trust someone you don’t know) but if you haven’t left this page yet, then you must want to hear an explanation.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The answer is in the clouds.</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Up until these past couple of years, businesses primarily streamed, operated, stored and shared their data using servers and standard business software applications. While software like SAP and Windows Vista proved to be an effective way to work with data, the fact is it puts a damper on your company budget. That damper comes from the cost to run and maintain your database.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">We&#8217;ve all made that painful phone call to tech support. You know, the one where something should be on your computer screen, but for some reason it’s not and you have no idea why? So, as panic starts to build, you call technical support and if you’re lucky, they will fix the problem because you just realized that you can’t get any work done until they do. This whole process costs money. You pay for things like tech support, software, updates, printers, ink and paper, and electricity so that your business can continue running smoothly. Well, alas, there is another way, a cheaper way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can cut these costs and give your start-up a better chance of survival by eliminating your hard drives and servers all together and switching to cloud computing.<br />
<span id="more-224"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is cloud computing?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">It’s quite simple really. Cloud computing is a way to stream, share, process, and save data without the physical servers and operating systems. Instead of running your operating systems internally, cloud allows you to operate through a shared data center via the Internet. No strings attached.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-231" alt="Cloud computing for business" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/cloud-computing.jpg" width="300" height="234" /></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shall we talk about some other benefits of going cloud?</h2>
<p>Every computer-based program, at some point, will interrupt your busy workday with a friendly reminder to update your software. This normally wouldn’t be a problem. Updates, upgrades and new versions of business software are a good thing, but the problem lies in time management.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Every time you update your business software, you are taking valuable minutes/hours away from more important things like generating leads or working on proposals. With the cloud, you have someone else doing all this for you. No updates, no new versions, all you have to do is log in, customize and you’re there.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Think of it like any other consumer web-based application. Let’s take Facebook for example. When we use Facebook, do we ever worry about physically updating to a new version? How about if your server has enough bandwidth? Not a chance. The good people at Facebook take care of all of this so we can continue posting videos of our cats chasing laser pointers without any technical concerns. Nice kitty.</p>
<p> <object width="420" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Z_KbjKc2pcw?hl=en_GB&amp;version=3" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="420" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Z_KbjKc2pcw?hl=en_GB&amp;version=3" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p dir="ltr">Using the cloud is the same concept. It simply allows you to dedicate more of your time to actual business rather than what runs a business. This is why it&#8217;s great for big businesses trying to juggle big data, keeping it all in cloud programs in an organized, collaborative fashion. These already established businesses are going to want the security and reliability of going cloud, as well as the office space getting rid of servers, printers, copiers and other things that can clog up aisles.</p>
<p>Small businesses, start-ups or individuals will love going cloud, too, as they are looking to grow, without hiring an administrative staff to process things like payroll and billing. Businesses that are starting out in the world are going to want to dedicate as much time as they can on sales and growth so that they can stay competitive. They are not going to want to worry about overhead costs and network configurations that can ultimately slow your progress down. <span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Clouds not only save you time, but money, too!</h2>
<p>Going cloud is going green! No one likes spending money on the electric bill and the more energy you use may upset the earth and its environmentalists who live on it. The cloud is a good way to bring attention to both of these matters. (Plus going paperless in the end means more pandas in the world!)</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are not using cloud computing to run your business software and applications then you are most likely using an in-house operating system comprised of servers and a team of technical support. I’m talking about that closet room full of hard drives, outlet strips and cooling appliances. Using the cloud eliminates the need for this closet room and the hardware that’s in it, thus ending the need for the electricity used to run it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You see where this is going? Companies can spend a fortune on their electric bills. With the cloud, you can save that money you would usually spend on running your operating system and put it to use in other areas that will help your business grow like marketing plans or that Nespresso machine or ping pong table for the break room.</p>
<h2>But is cloud computing safe?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A new concept like the cloud will undoubtedly have some skepticism so it is in your best interest to do a little research. One disadvantage to making the switch seems to come from issue of privacy and safety. Having an in-house server eliminates most of the risk of your data being hacked or compromised by outsiders (unless its an inside job or a break-in.) A business debating a switch to the cloud might think that safety and security will be an issue because you are using a system that shares data publicly through the Internet. This concern is a valid one since there are people hacking into data every day. Heck, even the Pentagon has had security breaches in the past so being safe is never a sure thing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, as the <a href="http://www.katescomment.com/how-safe-is-cloud-computing-infographic/" target="_blank">Memset infographic that examines</a> cloud safety discovers, like any sort of document, anywhere, the safety issue is more man-made, less computer-made. Sadly, the bigger security risk is found within your own colleagues, which means that risk would exist with or without the cloud. With QWERTY being the world&#8217;s most popular password and 58 percent of employees having week passwords, it&#8217;s really important to educate your staff on using complicated, more secure passwords. It makes your entire cloud experience safer, while also following good business sense in general.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Cloud Security Infographic" src="http://cdn.katescomment.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Cloud-Security-Infographic-600px.jpg" width="540" height="2685" /></p>
<h2>Going cloud increases your odds</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Any business large or small has tougher odds of making it in today’s economy. If you are looking to flip those odds, it’s time to start looking for ways to better them. The future is in the clouds. You can stay competitive and increase your efficiency and win rates by switching to cloud today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, we know documents, contracts and forms are not exciting things to talk about, let alone to create or read. We all go a little cross-eyed with Excel spreadsheets and grow impatient while trying to download, edit and re-upload Word docs. So, why are we still stuck in our boring document ways? It doesn&#8217;t have to be this way anymore! The multi-demensional cloud-based world has finally provided us with an alternative to the humdrum, two-dimensional document. Today we are going to offer you a quick and easy way to turn your boring old-school docs into professional, interactive web-based experiences. <span id="more-152"></span></p>
<h2>Put it all in one place</h2>
<p>Someone sends you a document, you make the edits and send it back, they make more and send it back to you, and so it continues. Your harddrives fill up with multiple versions of the same file, and it becomes difficult even to distinguish which is which. Your company implements FTP sites or share folders, which help a bit, until your colleague goes out for a coffee, leaving the file open and now you can&#8217;t open it until she gets back. The share folder helps you stay better organized, but has a limited capacity, keeps crashing and still isn&#8217;t collaborative enough. Forget when you have to print, sign and scan things. <span style="font-size: 13px;">Instead, try out a new way to handle any business document: Try Pandadoc.</span></p>
<h2>Get rid of attachments</h2>
<figure><img class="alignleft" alt="Smart documents" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/smart-documents.jpg" width="300" height="300" />Who here hates attachments? (I imagine everyone reading this is thrusting their hand into the air, nodding emphatically, until you notice the odd looks your colleagues are throwing your way.) In this day and age, attachments are completely unnecessary. With a cloud-based e-doc, you only need to send your colleagues a link and they can open the same doc at the same time. There&#8217;s no need to download, upload or waste time trying to find the document you&#8217;re looking for. This also makes your information more secure because your documents aren&#8217;t getting passed around and saved on various servers; instead everything is kept on one secure cloud-based website, accessible to anyone you choose from anywhere.</p>
<p>Plus, how often have you been waiting for a large document to upload or download? Or when you find that your email only allows 10KB and you have a video or something much larger to send? When everything&#8217;s online, you can fret about attachment size no more.</p>
<p>Anyway, wouldn&#8217;t that video or image look more convincing within the document you are trying to get signed, instead of overlooked in a disorganized batch of attachments? With Pandadoc, you can create a high-def, interactive, multimedia experience for your doc recipients.</p>
<h2>Start collaborating</h2>
<p>Think of your job like a puzzle. Your team is creating a contract, sales proposal, business plan or other document that involves a lot of pieces. Instead of each person getting up to put a couple pieces in place, while the others wait, you can get it together much faster if everyone chips in to put together their section. With yesterday&#8217;s documents, it was impossible to work in the same document at once. Now, all of you can work within the same cloud. Each person can not only get done what he needs to, when it&#8217;s convenient for him, he can see what his colleagues are doing and give them constructive, just-in-time feedback.</p>
<h2>Track your documents</h2>
<p>Using cloud-based e-documents allows the sender to know immediately when the document is opened, what the receiver is looking at, and how much time they spent on the docs. No longer are you emailing important paperwork, only to twiddle your thumbs, while you worry if they&#8217;ve even opened it. Now you can know right away if they opened it and you can see what they are spending time looking at to prepare a more informed follow-up action. If you are waiting for multiple people to sign off on the same document, you know who in the chain of signatures you need to give a little push to do their part.</p>
<h2>Integrate &amp; Automate</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the documents that can go cloud, it&#8217;s your entire business lifecycle. That&#8217;s why you should not only collaborate and create all your documents online, you should do all your business online. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great, for example, if you are creating an online business plan and you could just pull the necessary financial data from Xero or FreeAgent and drag-n-drop include it in a seamless way?</p>
<p>Pandadoc is easily extendible with additional functionality with its apps. The apps are inserted into or overlay the document, making it more interactive and flexible. Pandadoc allows you to customize each document within the software space. This means that you get what you need, when you need it, and don&#8217;t have to worry about digging through the stuff you don&#8217;t want or need.</p>
<h2>Flexibility</h2>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-180 alignright" alt="Flexible documents" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/flexible-documents.jpg" width="300" height="188" />We are used to being always connected. Blackberry has made billions off a generation of crackberry addicts who cannot leave their work. Frustratingly, it&#8217;s difficult to load things on the majority of smartphones and tablets because you have to download software, updates, etc. Using a SaaS means that you are able to work when the moment strikes and that your clients and other signees can act in the same flexible way, opening your document from anywhere at any time.</p>
<p>Not bound to the predictable A4 letter size, the shape- and space- responsive Pandadoc means your clients and colleagues can read it on any type of device, from laptop to desktop to smartphone. With the flexibility of a secure e-signature, things can get signed off on quickly. This is especially beneficial to traveling sales reps and other business folks who travel often or anyone who can&#8217;t wait around for approval or afford to express ship documents to multiple locations for signatures.</p>
<p><em><strong>So what are you waiting for?! Impress your clients, friends and clients&#8217; and friends&#8217; mothers by putting all your documents on a cloud today!</strong></em></figure>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Print. Sign. Scan. Attach. Send. Repeat. Print. Sign. Scan. Attach. Send. Repeat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For most businesses this is an antiquated and unnecessary routine. The world has rapidly spun fax machines and scanners into obsoletion. With the evolution of laws and technology, you no longer are left slowing down your contracts and negotiations with these fussy, less secure ways of getting them signed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Every company is looking for ways to get things done faster and more efficiently. Getting things approved is one more hurdle Pandadoc helps you overcome.</p>
<p dir="ltr">E-signatures, sometimes called digital signatures, are a natural, professional, cost-effective reality in all contracting, sales and agreed-upon documents. We’ve evolved from centuries of melted wax and stamps or even blood to the pen to now the screen. Maybe one day soon it’ll be retinal scans? Until that happens, if you don’t have e-signatures integrated into your sales process, you and your business are probably missing out.<br />
<span id="more-126"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignright" alt="Man On Street Use Ipad Tablet Computer" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/e-signature-on-the-go.jpg" width="300" height="200" />Since 1999, countries have started adopting e-signatures as equal to written ones in order to expedite global commerce online. So far, 19 nations have completely accepted secure e-signatures as holding the same weight as a written one, while eight have accepted the two types of signatures as essentially equal under the law. At least 27 countries have for a long time trusted in the security and business effectiveness of using e-signatures. If this is true, why shouldn’t your company do the same?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.google.es/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.quoteroller.com%2F2013%2F03%2F27%2Fuse-your-ipad-to-drive-your-sale%2F&amp;ei=2HhmUe3hB8SKhQfX_oDIAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7EeIhLdUo2mRkS8jxNjsMt8B2EA&amp;bvm=bv.45107431,d.ZG4">In the interconnected world of tablets and iPads</a>, you’re entire sales and negotiation process can be mobile. In the same way, your clients are often reading your sale proposal while they are at lunch, in the metro, maybe even in the bathroom. If they like what you’re offering them, you don’t want to give them time to rethink by printing, rereading in the printed format, then signing, then scanning and emailing back or waiting for you to pick it up… well, there’s a lot of room to reconsider. But if they can just use their mouse, stylus or finger to give you their John Hancock, you’ve sealed the deal. And you did it more quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the signee has questions, Pandadoc also allows him or her to broach them within the online document, highlighting and commenting on each specific part in question.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pandadoc makes your company more efficient, too. More often than not, especially as the worldwide recession re-escalates, multiple people need to sign off on anything that costs more than $25. Add to this that many are working increasingly from home or at offices across towns, countries and the world. Instead of having to print and fax or express snailmail copies from place to place, you can use e-signatures to get your everything signed much quicker, saving on expenses and time.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="size-medium wp-image-136 alignleft" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" alt="Business woman working at the Airport with mobile device" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/E-signature-anywhere.jpg" width="300" height="224" />Your clients will like e-signatures, too. It’s easier, saves on costs like printing, paper and travel, and is more secure than most options. No matter how trustworthy you are, not having to leave their scanned signatures in your email or around your office gives your clients more confidence — in you, your company and the service or product it’s presenting. Pandadoc’s secure e-signatures mean documents stay in an encrypted environment, which also means your private pricing isn’t just lying around your client’s office or your business plan around your potential investor’s — just in case a competitor pops in with wandering eyes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since e-signing is so convenient, it gives you that edge over a competitor who doesn’t have the option. Plus, it simply makes both of your lives easier, when it comes down to tax time and auditing, to have everything in one place, securely online.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Plus, extra bonus, without the need to print contracts, proposals, business plans and the like, you are saving money and helping to save the earth and the pandas that live here!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">You&#8217;ve started a new business or are looking to grow your current one. You meet with potential investors and then you email them your business plan. And you wait. And then you wait some more. You know they&#8217;re busy and you don&#8217;t want to be too pushy, but you don&#8217;t even know if they&#8217;ve looked at it yet. It&#8217;s one of the most frustrating feelings, being ready to drive your professional life forward, while impatiently stuck in park, wondering:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Have they opened it yet?</span></li>
<li>What if they&#8217;ve looked at it and hated it?</li>
<li>What if they&#8217;ve looked at it and loved it, but lost our contact info?</li>
<li>What if they have questions?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, the not knowing is worse than a No.</p>
<p dir="ltr">No longer is that intense stress necessary. When you build your business plan online, you can learn right away not only when your prospective investors and other interested parties have opened the document, but exactly what they have spent time looking at. You learn how much time they are spending looking at each part &#8212; so you can prepare yourself to respond to their uncertainties.<br />
<span id="more-130"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The ability to read your potential investors&#8217; minds</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The most likely situation is that your potential advisors, investors and loan officers are going to have follow-up questions &#8212; they&#8217;re almost always going to want more than what they see at first glance. If you do an interactive online business plan, then they can ask the questions right in the document, commenting on the specific text in question.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Knowing <em>what</em> they are thinking <em>when</em> they are thinking it gives you a powerful tool &#8212; mind-reading gives you intense power, particularly when asking people for help and support. If you create an online business plan, you know what objections and concerns your readers have immediately, giving you a heads up to research the answers to their questions and allowing you to prepare a well-armed follow-up.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Benefits of building an online business plan are boundless</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">First and foremost, you want to spend your time building your business, not creating documents. Building an online business plan allows you to be more productive, moving past unnecessary struggles like layout and formatting to stay focused on the message and vision of your business.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" alt="Business plan presentation" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/business-plan-presentation.jpg" width="240" height="300" />An online business plan is a great way to stand out from the start-up pack. It shows that your business is professional, forward-thinking, creative, flexible and open to feedback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">By inviting those investors into your environment to view your business plan, you are bringing them closer to your organization, staying engaged throughout the process, and putting forth a much better brand image in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Having an online business plan also allows you to give a dynamic presentation to investors. We all know PowerPoint is passé, so why not instead take them on a journey inside your interactive online plan?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Plus, if your business or sector involves any sort of technology, an old-fashioned stagnant business plan will make you look, well, old-fashioned and stagnant. However, if those adjectives describe your investors, you still have the option of turning your online plan into a simple PDF to print it out for them and their red pens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Creating an online business plan is made easier because it&#8217;s inherently more collaborative. You, your teammates and your advisors can all work together within the cloud-based business plan at the same time. This is important because your technical experts sure know what they&#8217;re talking about, but then your marketing and sales guys can help them buff it up, rephrasing everything in a more compelling manner. Before even sending your plan into the den of your potential investors, your advisors (and trusted family and friends) can interact with and evaluate your drafts. Furthermore, since many of us are starting businesses with people from around the world, building an online business plan can be done from anywhere.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An online business plan also gives you more freedom to &#8220;show &#8216;em what ya got.&#8221; Its multimedia assets allow you to include a portfolio, video testimonials, an introduction to your staff and so much more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While it doesn&#8217;t include a copyright, your online business plan can give you a sense of security. First, with everything online, only being sent via a secure server to only those you want to see it, there&#8217;s less of a chance of it falling into the wrong hands. Also, in the off chance that a so-called investor or collaborator ends up going ahead and releasing a project similar to yours, your in-document analytics can prove when your business plan was created and when your antagonist first saw your work. It can help create a timeframe, if an unfortunate legal situation comes up.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>How do to build an online business plan</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">You have an all-star idea for a business, but articulating it persuasively on paper is harder than you think. Plus, you are so busy building your business that you perpetually put off writing your business plan. By the time you&#8217;re ready to write it, it&#8217;s the eleventh hour, you&#8217;re almost out of time and you need to do something fast. You do not have time to learn something fussy and new.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignright" alt="Ideas for a business plan" src="http://pandadoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/how-to-build-business-plan.jpg" width="252" height="300" />Business plan software helps you organize your plan, taking you step-by-step through the creation process. It provides sample headers and templates so you can just fill in the blanks, not risking forgetting something important.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now that you have the tool, the next step is to brainstorm with your team:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">What is the key information about our company? The key benefits/solution we provide?</span></li>
<li>Where do we see ourselves in one year? Three years? Five?</li>
<li>What are we asking for?</li>
<li>What is our financial plan?</li>
<li>Why now?</li>
<li>What do we bring to the table?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more questions you can ask yourselves. These responses have to come from you and your team, but your business plan software will help you organize it in the proper way. You and your company can either plan out the details ahead of time or, if you&#8217;re under the wire, you can just type them into the fields already waiting for you online.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What to look for in a business plan software</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">You don&#8217;t need to worry about downloading or setting up a complicated software &#8212; you need everything to be intuitive, straightforward and easy-to-use. You also want a software that offers business plan templates that fit with your organization and industry, but that give you freedom to customize the look and feel. With a cloud-based software like Pandadoc, you don&#8217;t have to worry about fussy plug-ins or downloads, you can collaborate with teammates across offices, and you can create a multimedia business plan, with links to your official website, press, videos and photos. An app-based software is probably best because you need the online business plan system to be compatible with the financial programs you use, so you can include charts and graphs, as well as other fiscal statistics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, no matter how easy a software makes it, it&#8217;s important to make sure the system is backed up by a good customer support team that can help you when you get stuck and can respond quickly to any questions or concerns you may have along the way.</p>
<p><strong>But beware!</strong></p>
<p>Using a business plan template can make everything easier, but don&#8217;t let it make you lazy. The major risk with business plan software and business plan templates is the boilerplate. Investors and bankers can spot a canned business plan from the mile away. Of course, having a business plan template helps you organize your business plan in the popular order, without having to worry about margins, pagebreaks or layout. It also provides you with some of the typical legalize and can help you create all the necessary charts &#8212; cash flow, profits/losses, etc. &#8212; and let&#8217;s you present it in a multimedia fashion. It does not, however, do all the work for you.</p>
<p>There are many ways online business plan templates can make your life easier, but, in the end, a business plan must have a touch of the original, the memorable. Make sure to take your time to think about your audience, making sure you answer all of their questions clearly and concisely within your plan. In order for investors to find you attractive, you need to make sure your business plan is well-thought-out and makes a strong argument. No matter how much of your professional life you can automate, the vision and personality of your business must still be organic.</p>
<p><strong>In the end</strong></p>
<p>Writing a business plan can be a tedious exercise, but it&#8217;s a crucial one for the future of your business. It&#8217;s not just about attracting investors; creating a business plan helps you and your team organize your business better, with one eye on its present state and the other on building a future together. An online business plan can&#8217;t do all of this for you &#8212; it just does some of the work for you, so you can dedicate your efforts to what&#8217;s really important.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">We do our shopping, get our news, and keep in touch online. For most of us, the screens of our computers, phones, or iPads are the first things we see in the morning and the last we see at night. We’ve become accustomed to information at our fingertips in a manner of nanoseconds, while we’re out to lunch, on a plane, in the office or at home. We want to  make decisions quickly, and to sign off on them in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Word-processing documents no longer make sense. It’s time for business documents to be completely integrated into our fast-paced, cloud-based world. Even in the same office, you need a SaaS that allows you to work together on documents, not a Word doc that you have to download, edit, email, upload, and re-download again.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your clients are the same way. They want to <strong>spend less time on the documents</strong> you send. Want a proposal to be accepted, a contract to be signed, or an invoice to be paid? Make it easy for them to accept, sign, pay, negotiate, ask you questions, forward for managerial approval, etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&#8216;Emailing documents around is not an option if you want to have a clear and transparent workflow.&#8217;</em><span id="more-163"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Those days of emailing, printing and signing documents, then scanning and emailing them back are of yesterday. <a href="https://www.echosign.adobe.com/en/misc/international-Esignatures.html">Twenty-seven countries have given legal weight</a> to e-signatures, with many more in the works. This means that you can take advantage of the mobile world for the end-to-end process of any contractual or business document, and you can get things signed and confirmed in a matter of moments!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>It’s time for Pandadoc.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Pandadoc offers you a solution to draft, send, track, annotate, and sign documents in a fast, secure and professional way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pandadoc comes from the makers of <a href="http://www.quoteroller.com" target="_blank">Quote Roller</a>, a quoting automation software. The idea for Pandadoc came from some of Quote Roller’s clients, who liked the product, but wanted to use it for more than just sales proposals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We realized it was high time that you had a platform for modern, multi-media documents that can be built, sent, opened and signed quickly and easily online. And just like with Qutoe Roller, we are building a rock-solid cloud-based platform and dependable, down-to-earth service that responds and evolves with <strong>customer needs</strong>.</p>
